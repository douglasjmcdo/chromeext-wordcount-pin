## Chrome Extension: Pin Paragraph for WordCount
### Functionality
This extension allows users to pin any `<p>` tag within an article and toggle a word count display in the paragraph's bottom right.

### How (And Where) to Use
This extension is unpacked and must be added via chrome://extensions/ developer mode.
For safety, this extension is currently limited on any website matching:
- `https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/*`
- `https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/*`
        
For demo purposes, I recommend trying the following: 
- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/scripts-on-every-tab
- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/review-process

### Initial Drafting
For those interested in seeing my iteration process, my progress in learning Chrome extensions is documented in the following repository:
